Lecture 11 — Lists
==================

Overview
--------

-  So far we’ve looked at working with individual values and variables.

-  We realized that this is cumbersome and so we started working with iterables like Tuples.

-  This is a way to aggregate multiple values and refer to them using a
   single variable.

-  With Lists we will get acquainted with an extremely flexible iterable object type in Python.

-  Unlike tuples or strings, Lists are mutable as we will learn.

This lecture is largely based on Sections 8.1-8.3 of *Practical Programming*.

Lists are Sequences of Values
-----------------------------

-  Put together values that have common meaning.

-  As a first example, here are scores of 10 students for a test:

   ::

       scores = [95, 78, 63, 63, 68, 84, 88, 93, 71, 80]

-  As a second example, here are the names of the planets in the solar
   system:

   ::

       planet_names = ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mras', 'Jupiter',
           'Saturn', 'Neptune', 'Uranus']

-  Notes on syntax:

   -  Begin with ``[`` and end with ``]``.

   -  Commas separate the individual values.

   -  The spaces between values are optional and are used for clarity
      here.

   -  Any type of object may be stored in a list, and each list can mix
      different types.
