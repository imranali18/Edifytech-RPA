Lecture 4 â€” Using Operators,Input and Logic in Solving Problems
===============================================================

Reading
-------
This Lecture is aimed at solving problems based on arithmetic operations,
user input, elementary boolean logic and comaprison operators.
In order to solve these problems plase reveiew the Lecture 2 and Lecture 3
material.

In addition we will work with some numerical functions that are quite useful
when working with numbers.

What have we learned so far?
----------------------------
-Python as a calculator

-Variables and Expressions

-User Input

-Boolean Logic

-Comparison Operators


How about numerical functions?
------------------------------

- Many numerical functions also exist. Let us experiment with some of
  these first. You should make a note of what they do:

   -  :func:`abs`

   -  :func:`pow`

   -  :func:`int`

   -  :func:`float`

   -  :func:`round`

   -  :func:`max`

   -  :func:`min`

-  We will look carefully in class at how these work.


The Problem Set for Today
