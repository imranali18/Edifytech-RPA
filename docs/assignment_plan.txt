This outlines the concepts developments and practiced in lecture
exercises, labs and homeworks.  The intent is to provide a smooth
development sequence:

Lecture 1, intro (8/29)

Lab 0 (8/30, 8/31):
1. Environment
2. Play with triple double code

Lecture 2, calculations (9/1)
1. Temperature conversion
2. Volume and area of solid
3. What is the output

Lab 1 (9/6, 9/7):
1. Volume of cylinder
2. Lecture 2 exercises
3. Size of hard drive calculations

HW 1 (out 9/8, due 9/15):
1. Distance ratios
2. Earth / Jupiter distance calculations
3. (Something else ... look back at old assignments)

Lecture 3, strings (9/8):
practice with basics

Lecture 4, modules and functions (9/12):
practice with string functions
practice with 

Lab 2 (9/13, 9/14): Strings and string functions  (DONE)
1. Framing Spam
2. Framing any four letter word (needs revision)
3. Framing any word
4. Framed greeting

HW 2 (out 9/15, due 9/22)
Needs work, but should be adaptable from old assignments:
1. Madlibs (old HW 1)
2. Encryption
3. Decryption. or some variation.  Need output formatting though.

Lecture 5, writing functions (9/15):

Lecture 6, decisions (9/19):

Lab 3 (9/20, 9/21): functions and decisions
