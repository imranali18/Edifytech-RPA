Lecture 7 â€” Functions
=======================================

Overview
--------

-  In todays Lecture we discuss functions.

- A function in Python is a 'chunk of code' that is written once and can be used again and again.

- Re-usability plays a significant role in debugging and breaking down complex problems into simpler
and smaller steps.


What is a function?
-------------------

A body of code that takes an input, does some computation and returns a value.

Some built in functions include len, print, int, float etc.

What is Module?
---------------

Embedding two or more functions together creates a module.

A module has multiple 'related' functions. The module needs to

be imported before use. Once imported its functions can be called

and used.
