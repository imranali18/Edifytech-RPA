Lecture 3 â€” Python Logic and Statements
===============================================

Reading
-------

This material is drawn from Chapter 5 of *Practical Programming*, 3rd
edition.



Making Choices
---------------

-  One of the fundamental reason of using programming is to solve problems.

-  A major portion of problem solving involves decision making therefore very early
on in the course we will learn about Boolean Types in Python.

- We will build Boolean expressions and understand their outcomes and get acquainted with
operators in Python.

- If-Else statements (Also called control flow statements) play an important role in
structuring the flow of decision making steps in programs. We will discuss those as well.


Topics for Today
----------------

-  Comparison Operators

-  Boolean Types

-  If-Else Statements
